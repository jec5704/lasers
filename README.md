# lasers
Pair project using Graphical User Interfaces to implement a game similar to the japanes game Akari 

the user is able to utiize a graphical user interfeca or a plain text user interface depending on the 
user input on the command line arguments. In order to play the game, the user must have a file that will
be read by the program in order to make a 2d array that contains the board. When the user clicks on
an empty space, a laser or light bulb is placed in the spot selected, and the idea of the game is to
fill out the board completely with the light from the lasers. no lasers can point directly towards 
another one and there are also pillars in the board to fill, and depending on the number in the 
pillar, there has to be exactly that many pillars in the board. If the user gets stuck in the 
process of solving the board a backtracking algorithm can solve the board if there is any possible solution.
